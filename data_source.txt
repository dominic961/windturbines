On data.world, a platform for sharing data resources, I found a dataset from the US Wind Turbines Database. This dataset includes locations of wind turbines in the United States, wind project information, and turbine technical specifications.

I thought it would be interesting to see how the US government (assuming the government 100% funds all wind projects) can expand new projects over the next couple of years.For this case study I will be using Snowflake and SQL for the data preparation and analysis. After I will link Tableau to my Snowflake database, to perform further analysis and build visualisations.
